This is a simple School Management System which is created using raw Php and mysql. 

I haven't worked too much on the front end, because this was already been taken care of by admin LTE template. I just configured it according to my settings. 

Then the back end part is done using pure php and mysql. I used LAMP stack as my development environment.

This system contains the following modules: 

=> Individual module for admin, teacher, parent & student 
=> Courses for specific class
=> Results (both individual and combined)
=> Attendance
=> Info about everyone (privacy is well maintained)
=> corresponding profiles
=> report module (teacher can send report to the parents)

This is not the final version, just a prototype. I'll try to enhance and modify it by adding more features. 
Hope you like it!!
